## Assumptions (≤5)

1. Core workflow is still **brush-based manual removal** (no “Continue Editing” CTA on the homepage—only guidance that the option exists inside the editor). 
2. Upload supports **JPG, PNG, HEIC, WEBP**. 
3. **Batch / multi-photo processing is not supported for now** (each photo is handled one at a time). (Based on your latest instruction + we will remove “Batch workflow” from pricing.) 
4. “AI Edit” is accessible **inside the editor after removal**, via a **“Continue Editing”** action. 
5. AI Edit is positioned as an **optional add-on after removal**, not required for clean removal results.

### H1 Hero — Remove people from photos

**H1:** Remove people from photos online

**Pain line (light, practical):**
Get clean photos without spending hours in Photoshop—or sending personal images to strangers.

**Subhead:**
Upload a photo, brush over the people you want gone, and download a clean result—while keeping everything you want to keep untouched.

**Micro trust points:**

* Clean, natural-looking results (even at 100% zoom).
* Keep X, remove Y: you choose exactly who stays in the frame.
* Privacy-first processing from upload to download.

**Primary CTA:** Upload Photo
**Secondary CTA:** Try a sample

**Uploader helper:**
Drag and drop an image here, or click to upload. Supports JPG, PNG, HEIC, and WEBP.

---

### H2 How it works

**Step 1 — Upload your photo**
Pick the photo you want to clean up.

**Step 2 — Brush to remove people**
Brush only the person/people you want gone—everything else stays untouched.

**Step 3 — Download your clean photo**
Export when it looks right (and zoom in to double-check edges).

**One-line add-on (sets up AI Edit without undermining removal):**
After removal, you can optionally go further inside the editor with AI Edit—like re-framing, background changes, pose adjustments, and style tweaks.

---

### H2 Real-world results (scenarios + proof, together)

**Subtitle:** Common scenarios people search for—solved with a simple brush workflow.
**Verification cue (credibility mechanism):** Click any example to **zoom in** and inspect **edges, patterns, and shadows**—that’s where “fake-looking” edits get exposed.

**Slider labels (global):** Original / Cleaned

---

#### H3 1) Travel landmarks / crowds

**Copy (2–3 sentences):**
Turn busy travel shots into cleaner memories. Use the brush to **remove background people from photos** while keeping the landmark and your main subject intact.
**What to verify at 100%:** straight lines (rails/buildings), repeating textures (brick/stone), and ground shadows.

**Alt text (Before):** “Crowded landmark photo with background tourists.”
**Alt text (After):** “Same landmark photo after removing people from the background.”

---

#### H3 2) Photobombers

**Copy (2–3 sentences):**
Remove a person from a photo when someone jumps into the frame. Brush the photobomber only—your subject stays untouched.
**What to verify at 100%:** hair/shoulder edges, clothing seams, and contact points on the ground.

**Alt text (Before):** “Street photo with a photobomber behind the subject.”
**Alt text (After):** “Street photo after removing the photobomber cleanly.”

---

#### H3 3) Keep only certain people (keep X, remove Y)

**Copy (2–3 sentences):**
Keep the people you care about and remove the rest—whether that’s background strangers or someone you’d rather not keep in the frame. This is the fastest way to **remove unwanted people from pictures** without redoing the whole photo.
**What to verify at 100%:** edges where removed people were close to the group, plus any shared shadows.

**Alt text (Before):** “Group photo with several extra people in the frame.”
**Alt text (After):** “Group photo with only selected people kept after removal.”

---

#### H3 4) Solo portrait from a group shot

**Copy (2–3 sentences):**
Need a clean “just me” photo? Remove others from a group shot to create a solo portrait for a memorial slideshow, presentation, profile photo, or resume.
**What to verify at 100%:** skin texture, background continuity, and any overlap near shoulders/hair.

**Alt text (Before):** “Group photo intended to be turned into a solo portrait.”
**Alt text (After):** “Solo portrait created by removing other people from the group photo.”

---

#### H3 5) Print-worthy moments

**Copy (2–3 sentences):**
For weddings, events, invitations, and framed prints, small mistakes become obvious. Brush removal helps you get a cleaner photo that still looks authentic—especially when you zoom in.
**What to verify at 100%:** fine detail (lace, hair, fabric edges), lighting consistency, and pattern repetition.

**Alt text (Before):** “Event photo with distracting background people.”
**Alt text (After):** “Event photo cleaned for a print-ready look after removing people.”

**Under-gallery CTA:** Upload your photo to try it now.

---

### H2 Brush removal quality proof

**Opening (user-language first):**
“Clean” means your photo doesn’t look weird or fake—especially when you **zoom to 100%**. If the edit falls apart up close, it’s not done.

#### H3 The 100% zoom test

Zoom in and look for anything that screams “edited”: repeated patterns, smudged edges, warped lines, or impossible shadows.

#### H3 What “clean” means (quick checklist)

* **Texture continuity:** grass, waves, walls, tiles don’t break or repeat in blocks.
* **Structure stays straight:** rails, window frames, signs don’t warp.
* **Lighting matches:** shadows/highlights make sense in the scene.
* **Edges stay sharp:** hair, hands, clothing seams don’t look melted.

#### H3 What if people overlap?

Overlap is the hardest case (hair/hands/arms touching). For best results: zoom in, work in small sections, and spend extra time on tight edges and shared shadows.

**Print note (moved here, per your doc):**
Higher-resolution photos preserve more fine detail—especially for print use.

**Inline CTA:** Upload Photo

---

### H2 Continue editing (AI Edit) — optional, after removal

**Lead (clarifies “optional”):**
You can remove people with the brush and export immediately. If you want more than removal, AI Edit lets you go further **after** the cleanup.

**How to access (entry clarity):**
After brush removal, click **“Continue Editing”** inside the editor to use AI Edit.

**Important visual note for your sliders (copy-level guidance):**
In this section, the **“Before”** image should be the **already-cleaned (people removed) result**, so users understand this is *second-step editing*.

**Slider labels (this module):** After removal / After AI Edit

---

#### H3 1) Re-frame after removal

Refine composition once the distraction is gone—re-center the subject, tighten the crop, and fill remaining space naturally.

**Alt text (Before):** “Photo after removing people, composition still feels off.”
**Alt text (After):** “Same photo re-framed after removal for a cleaner composition.”

---

#### H3 2) Change background

Swap the setting to match the moment—clean studio, scenic location, or a simpler backdrop that fits your photo.

**Alt text (Before):** “Cleaned photo with original background.”
**Alt text (After):** “Cleaned photo with a new background applied.”

---

#### H3 3) Adjust pose

Make precise posture and pose adjustments to get a more natural, intentional photo.

**Alt text (Before):** “Cleaned photo with original pose.”
**Alt text (After):** “Cleaned photo with adjusted pose.”

---

#### H3 4) Style and mood

Tune lighting and color for a consistent vibe—natural, cinematic, studio, or warm event tones.

**Alt text (Before):** “Cleaned photo with original color and lighting.”
**Alt text (After):** “Cleaned photo with updated style and mood.”

**Plan note (kept safe):**
AI Edit is available inside the editor after removal. See Pricing for plan details.

### H2 FAQ

#### 功能 / 能力

1. **How do I remove people from photos online?**
   Upload your photo, brush over the people you want to remove, then download the result.

2. **Can I keep some people and remove others (keep X, remove Y)?**
   Yes. Brush only who you want gone—everyone else stays untouched.

3. **Can I remove multiple people at once?**
   Yes. Remove people in sections for better control, especially in crowds or busy backgrounds.

4. **Can I make a solo portrait from a group photo?**
   Yes. Remove others from the group shot, then export or re-frame for a clean solo portrait.

5. **Can I remove crowds or background people from travel photos?**
   Yes. For large crowds, removing in smaller sections helps keep textures and lines looking natural.

#### 质量 / 效果

6. **How do I avoid an “AI look” after removal?**
   Zoom to 100% and check edges, repeating patterns, and shadows. If it looks believable up close, it’ll look great everywhere.

7. **Will it work on complex backgrounds (trees, fences, crowds, patterns)?**
   Often yes—complex textures just require more careful brushing and a closer 100% check.

8. **What if people overlap or block each other (hair/hands/clothing)?**
   Overlap is harder. Zoom in, work in small sections, and expect an extra pass around tight edges and shared shadows.

9. **Does it handle veils, lace, or semi-transparent materials?**
   It can, but thin/semi-transparent edges need careful brushing. Zoom in and work slowly around the edge details.

#### 技术 / 限制

10. **Does it work on my phone?**
    Yes—use it in a modern mobile browser (Safari or Chrome). No app download needed.

11. **Can I use a video screenshot or low-resolution image?**
    Yes, but lower-resolution sources limit fine detail—especially for print. Best results come from original photos when possible.

12. **Can I remove people from multiple photos at once (batch)?**
    Not yet. Each photo is processed individually for now.
