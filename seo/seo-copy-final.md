# Final Launch-Ready Copy — Remove People from Photos

## Assumptions

1. Core workflow is **brush-based manual removal** (no "Continue Editing" CTA on the homepage—only guidance that the option exists inside the editor).
2. Upload supports **JPG, PNG, HEIC, WEBP**.
3. **Batch / multi-photo processing is not supported** (each photo is handled one at a time).
4. "AI Edit" is accessible **inside the editor after removal**, via a **"Continue Editing"** action.
5. AI Edit is positioned as an **optional creative extension after removal**, not required for clean removal results.
6. **Overlap handling is a product strength**, not a limitation.

### H1 Hero — Remove people from photos

**H1:** Remove people from photos online

**Pain line:**
Get clean photos without spending hours in Photoshop—or sending personal images to strangers.

**Subhead:**
Upload a photo, brush over the people you want gone, and download a clean result—while keeping everything you want to keep untouched. Results update in real time as you brush.

**Micro trust points:**

- Clean, natural-looking results (even at 100% zoom).
- Keep X, remove Y: you choose exactly who stays in the frame.
- Privacy-first processing from upload to download.

**Primary CTA:** Upload Photo
**Secondary CTA:** Try a sample

**Uploader helper:**
Drag and drop an image here, or click to upload. Supports JPG, PNG, HEIC, and WEBP.

---

### H2 How it works

**Step 1 — Upload your photo**
Pick the photo you want to clean up.

**Step 2 — Brush to remove people**
Brush only the person or people you want gone—results appear as you brush. Everything else stays untouched.

**Step 3 — Download your clean photo**
Export when it looks right. Zoom in to double-check edges before you save.

**One-line add-on:**
After removal, you can go further inside the editor—fill empty space, move people closer, or swap the background entirely.

---

### H2 Real-world results

**Subtitle:** Common scenarios people search for—solved with a simple brush workflow.

**Verification cue:** Every example below holds up at 100% zoom. Click to inspect edges, textures, and shadows yourself.

**Slider labels (global):** Original / Cleaned

---

#### H3 1) Travel landmarks / crowds

**Copy:**
Turn busy travel shots into cleaner memories. Use the brush to **remove background people from photos** while keeping the landmark and your main subject intact. 

Straight lines stay straight, brick and stone textures flow naturally, and ground shadows disappear with the people who cast them—even at 100% zoom.

**Alt text (Before):** "Crowded landmark photo with background tourists."
**Alt text (After):** "Same landmark photo after removing people from the background."

---

#### H3 2) Photobombers

**Copy:**
**Remove photobombers from photos** when someone jumps into the frame at the worst moment. Brush the photobomber only—your subject stays untouched. 

Hair and shoulder edges stay crisp, clothing seams remain intact, and contact points on the ground blend seamlessly.

**Alt text (Before):** "Street photo with a photobomber behind the subject."
**Alt text (After):** "Street photo after removing the photobomber cleanly."

---

#### H3 3) Keep only certain people (keep X, remove Y)

**Copy:**
Keep the people you care about and remove the rest—whether that's background strangers, someone who's no longer in your life, or anyone you'd rather not keep in the frame. This is the fastest way to **remove unwanted people from pictures** without redoing the whole photo. 

Edges where removed people stood close to the group stay clean, and shared shadows are handled naturally.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo with several extra people in the frame."
**Alt text (After):** "Group photo with only selected people kept after removal."

---

#### H3 4) Solo portrait from a group shot

**Copy:**
Need a clean "just me" photo? **Remove others from a group shot** to create a solo portrait—for a memorial slideshow, presentation, profile photo, or resume. 

Skin texture stays natural, the background fills in seamlessly, and even tricky areas near shoulders and hair come out clean.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo intended to be turned into a solo portrait."
**Alt text (After):** "Solo portrait created by removing other people from the group photo."

---

#### H3 5) Print-worthy moments

**Copy:**
For weddings, events, invitations, and framed prints, small mistakes become obvious. Brush removal helps you get a cleaner photo that still looks authentic. 

Fine details like lace, hair, and fabric edges stay sharp. Lighting stays consistent. Patterns don't repeat unnaturally. The result holds up at full resolution—ready for print.

**Alt text (Before):** "Event photo with distracting background people."
**Alt text (After):** "Event photo cleaned for a print-ready look after removing people."

---

#### Overlap callout

**Title:** What about overlap?

**Copy:**
When people are pressed together—hair crossing, arms touching, shoulders overlapping—most removal tools leave obvious artifacts or smeared edges. Ours doesn't. Brush carefully in tight areas and get clean, natural results where others fail. Zoom in and see for yourself.

---

**Under-gallery CTA:** Upload your photo to try it now.

### H2 Go beyond removal

**Lead:**
Most removal tools stop at removal. Got an awkward gap where someone used to be? A lopsided composition? You're on your own—unless you want to open Photoshop.

We let you keep going. Fill the empty space, move people closer together, swap the background, or adjust the overall look—all inside the same editor, right after removal.

**How to access:**
After brush removal, click **"Continue Editing"** inside the editor.

**Slider labels (this module):** After removal / After AI Edit

---

#### H3 1) Fill space and re-compose

Removed someone from the edge of the frame? Now there's an awkward gap. Fill it naturally and re-center your subject—no need to crop away half the photo.

**Alt text (Before):** "Photo after removing a person, with awkward empty space on one side."
**Alt text (After):** "Same photo with space filled and subject re-centered."

---

#### H3 2) Move people closer

Removed the person in the middle of a group? Now the others look awkwardly far apart. Bring them together naturally—no cutting and pasting, no obvious seams.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo after removal, with a visible gap between remaining people."
**Alt text (After):** "Same group photo with people moved closer together."

---

#### H3 3) Change background

The removal is done, but the background doesn't match the moment. Swap to a cleaner backdrop—studio, scenic, or simply less distracting.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original busy background."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with a new, simpler background."

---

#### H3 4) Polish the look

Unify lighting and color so the final result feels intentional—natural tones, cinematic contrast, or a warmer mood for events and portraits.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original lighting and color."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with polished lighting and color."

**Plan note:**
AI Edit is available inside the editor after removal. See Pricing for plan details.

### H2 FAQ

#### Capability

1. **How do I remove people from photos online?**
   Upload your photo, brush over the people you want to remove, then download the result. Results update in real time as you brush.

2. **Can I keep some people and remove others (keep X, remove Y)?**
   Yes. Brush only who you want gone—everyone else stays untouched.

3. **Can I remove multiple people at once?**
   Yes. Remove people in sections for better control, especially in crowds or busy backgrounds.

4. **Can I make a solo portrait from a group photo?**
   Yes. Remove others from the group shot, then export or re-frame for a clean solo portrait.

5. **Can I remove crowds or background people from travel photos?**
   Yes. For large crowds, removing in smaller sections helps keep textures and lines looking natural.

6. **Can I move people closer together after removal?**
   Yes. After brush removal, click "Continue Editing" to bring people together naturally—no cutting and pasting required.

#### Quality

7. **How do I avoid an "AI look" after removal?**
   Zoom to 100% and check edges, repeating patterns, and shadows. If it looks believable up close, it'll look great everywhere.

8. **Will it work on complex backgrounds (trees, fences, crowds, patterns)?**
   Often yes—complex textures just require more careful brushing and a closer 100% check.

9. **What if people overlap or block each other (hair/hands/clothing)?**
   We handle overlap well. Zoom in, work in small sections, and you'll get clean edges even where people are touching or crossing.

10. **Does it handle veils, lace, or semi-transparent materials?**
    It can, but thin/semi-transparent edges need careful brushing. Zoom in and work slowly around the edge details.

11. **Will removal change the faces I want to keep?**
    No. Brush removal only affects the areas you brush. Faces and features you don't touch stay exactly as they are.

#### Technical

12. **Does it work on my phone?**
    Yes—use it in a modern mobile browser (Safari or Chrome). No app download needed.

13. **Can I use a video screenshot or low-resolution image?**
    Yes, but lower-resolution sources limit fine detail—especially for print. Best results come from original photos when possible.

14. **Can I remove people from multiple photos at once (batch)?**
    Not yet. Each photo is processed individually for now.

15. **How long does processing take?**
    Results appear in real time as you brush. Export is ready as soon as you're happy with the result.

#### Privacy

16. **Do you store my photos?**
    Photos are stored temporarily for processing and automatically deleted within 30 days. We do not share your photos publicly or use them to train AI models.
