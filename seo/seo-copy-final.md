# Final Launch-Ready Copy — Remove People from Photos

## Assumptions

1. Core workflow is **brush-based manual removal** (no "Continue Editing" CTA on the homepage—only guidance that the option exists inside the editor).
2. Upload supports **JPG, PNG, HEIC, WEBP**.
3. **Batch / multi-photo processing is not supported** (each photo is handled one at a time).
4. "AI Edit" is accessible **inside the editor after removal**, via a **"Continue Editing"** action.
5. AI Edit is positioned as an **optional creative extension after removal**, not required for clean removal results.
6. **Overlap handling is a product strength**, not a limitation.

### H1 Hero — Remove people from photos

**H1:** Remove people from photos online

**Pain line:**
Get clean photos without spending hours in Photoshop—or sending personal images to strangers.

**Subhead:**
Upload a photo, brush over the people you want gone, and download a clean result—while keeping everything you want to keep untouched. Results update in real time as you brush.

**Micro trust points:**

- Clean, natural-looking results (even at 100% zoom).
- Keep X, remove Y: you choose exactly who stays in the frame.
- Privacy-first processing from upload to download.

**Primary CTA:** Upload Photo
**Secondary CTA:** Try a sample

**Uploader helper:**
Drag and drop an image here, or click to upload. Supports JPG, PNG, HEIC, and WEBP.

---

### H2 How it works

**Step 1 — Upload your photo**
Pick the photo you want to clean up.

**Step 2 — Brush to remove people**
Brush only the person or people you want gone—results appear as you brush. Everything else stays untouched.

**Step 3 — Download your clean photo**
Export when it looks right. Zoom in to double-check edges before you save.

**One-line add-on:**
After removal, you can optionally go further inside the editor with AI Edit—like re-framing, background changes, or style adjustments.

---

### H2 Real-world results

**Subtitle:** Common scenarios people search for—solved with a simple brush workflow.

**Verification cue:** Click any example to **zoom in** and inspect **edges, patterns, and shadows**—that's where "fake-looking" edits get exposed.

**Slider labels (global):** Original / Cleaned

---

#### H3 1) Travel landmarks / crowds

**Copy:**
Turn busy travel shots into cleaner memories. Use the brush to **remove background people from photos** while keeping the landmark and your main subject intact.

**What to verify at 100%:** straight lines (rails/buildings), repeating textures (brick/stone), and ground shadows.

**Alt text (Before):** "Crowded landmark photo with background tourists."
**Alt text (After):** "Same landmark photo after removing people from the background."

---

#### H3 2) Photobombers

**Copy:**
**Remove photobombers from photos** when someone jumps into the frame at the worst moment. Brush the photobomber only—your subject stays untouched.

**What to verify at 100%:** hair/shoulder edges, clothing seams, and contact points on the ground.

**Alt text (Before):** "Street photo with a photobomber behind the subject."
**Alt text (After):** "Street photo after removing the photobomber cleanly."

---

#### H3 3) Keep only certain people (keep X, remove Y)

**Copy:**
Keep the people you care about and remove the rest—whether that's background strangers, someone who's no longer in your life, or anyone you'd rather not keep in the frame. This is the fastest way to **remove unwanted people from pictures** without redoing the whole photo.

**What to verify at 100%:** edges where removed people were close to the group, plus any shared shadows.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo with several extra people in the frame."
**Alt text (After):** "Group photo with only selected people kept after removal."

---

#### H3 4) Solo portrait from a group shot

**Copy:**
Need a clean "just me" photo? **Remove others from a group shot** to create a solo portrait—for a memorial slideshow, presentation, profile photo, or resume.

**What to verify at 100%:** skin texture, background continuity, and any overlap near shoulders/hair.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo intended to be turned into a solo portrait."
**Alt text (After):** "Solo portrait created by removing other people from the group photo."

---

#### H3 5) Print-worthy moments

**Copy:**
For weddings, events, invitations, and framed prints, small mistakes become obvious. Brush removal helps you get a cleaner photo that still looks authentic—especially when you zoom in.

**What to verify at 100%:** fine detail (lace, hair, fabric edges), lighting consistency, and pattern repetition.

**Alt text (Before):** "Event photo with distracting background people."
**Alt text (After):** "Event photo cleaned for a print-ready look after removing people."

**Under-gallery CTA:** Upload your photo to try it now.

### H2 Brush removal quality proof

**Opening:**
"Clean" means your photo doesn't look weird or fake—especially when you **zoom to 100%**. If the edit falls apart up close, it's not done.

#### H3 The 100% zoom test

Zoom in and look for anything that screams "edited": repeated patterns, smudged edges, warped lines, or impossible shadows.

#### H3 What "clean" means (quick checklist)

- **Texture continuity:** grass, waves, walls, tiles don't break or repeat in blocks.
- **Structure stays straight:** rails, window frames, signs don't warp.
- **Lighting matches:** shadows and highlights make sense in the scene.
- **Edges stay sharp:** hair, hands, clothing seams don't look melted.
- **Shadows make sense:** removed people don't leave ghost shadows or floating edges.

#### H3 Overlap? We handle it.

When people overlap—hair crossing, arms touching, shoulders pressed together—most tools struggle. Our brush handles these tight edges cleanly. Zoom in, work in small sections, and get natural results even where others fail.

**Print note:**
Higher-resolution photos preserve more fine detail—especially for print use. Pro exports up to 4K.

**Inline CTA:** Upload Photo

---

### H2 Continue editing (AI Edit) — optional, after removal

**Lead:**
Brush removal gives you a clean result you can export immediately. If you want to take it further, AI Edit unlocks creative options **after** the cleanup is done—no extra editing required for a clean removal.

**How to access:**
After brush removal, click **"Continue Editing"** inside the editor to use AI Edit.

**Slider labels (this module):** After removal / After AI Edit

---

#### H3 1) Re-frame after removal

Refine composition once the distraction is gone—re-center the subject, tighten the crop, and fill remaining space naturally.

**Alt text (Before):** "Photo after removing people, composition still feels off."
**Alt text (After):** "Same photo re-framed after removal for a cleaner composition."

---

#### H3 2) Change background

Swap the setting to match the moment—clean studio, scenic location, or a simpler backdrop that fits your photo.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original background."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with a new background applied."

---

#### H3 3) Adjust pose

Make precise posture and pose adjustments to get a more natural, intentional look.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original pose."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with adjusted pose."

---

#### H3 4) Style and mood

Tune lighting and color for a consistent vibe—natural, cinematic, studio, or warm event tones.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original color and lighting."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with updated style and mood."

**Plan note:**

### H2 FAQ

#### Capability

1. **How do I remove people from photos online?**
   Upload your photo, brush over the people you want to remove, then download the result. Results update in real time as you brush.

2. **Can I keep some people and remove others (keep X, remove Y)?**
   Yes. Brush only who you want gone—everyone else stays untouched.

3. **Can I remove multiple people at once?**
   Yes. Remove people in sections for better control, especially in crowds or busy backgrounds.

4. **Can I make a solo portrait from a group photo?**
   Yes. Remove others from the group shot, then export or re-frame for a clean solo portrait.

5. **Can I remove crowds or background people from travel photos?**
   Yes. For large crowds, removing in smaller sections helps keep textures and lines looking natural.

6. **Can I move people closer together after removal?**
   Yes. After brush removal, use "Continue Editing" to re-frame, adjust composition, or fill space naturally with AI Edit.

#### Quality

7. **How do I avoid an "AI look" after removal?**
   Zoom to 100% and check edges, repeating patterns, and shadows. If it looks believable up close, it'll look great everywhere.

8. **Will it work on complex backgrounds (trees, fences, crowds, patterns)?**
   Often yes—complex textures just require more careful brushing and a closer 100% check.

9. **What if people overlap or block each other (hair/hands/clothing)?**
   We handle overlap well. Zoom in, work in small sections, and you'll get clean edges even where people are touching or crossing.

10. **Does it handle veils, lace, or semi-transparent materials?**
    It can, but thin/semi-transparent edges need careful brushing. Zoom in and work slowly around the edge details.

11. **Will removal change the faces I want to keep?**
    No. Brush removal only affects the areas you brush. Faces and features you don't touch stay exactly as they are.

#### Technical

12. **Does it work on my phone?**
    Yes—use it in a modern mobile browser (Safari or Chrome). No app download needed.

13. **Can I use a video screenshot or low-resolution image?**
    Yes, but lower-resolution sources limit fine detail—especially for print. Best results come from original photos when possible.

14. **Can I remove people from multiple photos at once (batch)?**
    Not yet. Each photo is processed individually for now.

15. **How long does processing take?**
    Results appear in real time as you brush. Export is ready as soon as you're happy with the result.

#### Privacy

16. **Do you store my photos?**
    Photos are stored temporarily for processing and automatically deleted within 30 days. We do not share your photos publicly or use them to train AI models.
