# Final Launch-Ready Copy — Remove People from Photos

## Assumptions

1. Core workflow is **brush-based manual removal** (no "Continue Editing" CTA on the homepage—only guidance that the option exists inside the editor).
2. Upload supports **JPG, PNG, HEIC, WEBP**.
3. **Batch / multi-photo processing is not supported** (each photo is handled one at a time).
4. "AI Edit" is accessible **inside the editor after removal**, via a **"Continue Editing"** action.
5. AI Edit is positioned as a **key differentiator**—removal is complete on its own, but the ability to continue editing (move people, change backgrounds, etc.) sets us apart from competitors who stop at removal.
6. **Overlap handling is a product strength**, not a limitation.
7. **Paid-first model with free trial credits**—users get limited free tries before upgrading.

### How to remove people from photos

**Step 1 — Upload your photo**
Pick the photo you want to clean up.

**Step 2 — Brush to remove people**
Brush to mark who goes, tap Apply, and see results in seconds. Everything else stays untouched.

**Step 3 — Download your finished photo**
Your photo is ready. Export and use it anywhere—social media, print, or archive. Zoom in to double-check edges before you save.

<!-- DESIGN NOTE: The following "Optional" section should be visually secondary (smaller text or muted style) to reinforce that removal alone is complete. -->

**Optional:**
Already happy with the result? You're done. Want to do more? You can also move people closer, swap backgrounds, upscale for print, or adjust the composition.[See what else you can do →](#go-beyond-removal)

### H2 See it in action

**Subtitle:** Every example holds up at 100% zoom. Click to inspect edges, textures, and shadows yourself.

**Slider labels (global):** Original / Cleaned

---

#### H3 1) Travel landmarks / crowds

**Copy:**
Turn busy travel shots into cleaner memories. Use the brush to **remove strangers and tourists from photos** while keeping the landmark and your main subject intact.

Straight lines stay straight, brick and stone textures flow naturally, and ground shadows disappear with the people who cast them—even at 100% zoom.

**Alt text (Before):** "Crowded landmark photo with tourists and strangers in the background."
**Alt text (After):** "Same landmark photo after removing strangers from the background."

---

#### H3 2) Photobombers

**Copy:**
**Remove photobombers from photos** when someone jumps into the frame at the worst moment. Brush the photobomber only—your subject stays untouched.

Hair and shoulder edges stay crisp, clothing seams remain intact, and contact points on the ground blend seamlessly.

**Alt text (Before):** "Street photo with a photobomber behind the subject."
**Alt text (After):** "Street photo after removing the photobomber cleanly."

---

#### H3 3) Remove your ex

**Copy:**
Relationship over but the photos aren't? **Remove your ex from photos** and keep the memories that matter—without the person who doesn't. No need to send private photos to strangers online or pay someone you don't know.

Brush over your ex, download a clean result, and move on. Edges stay clean, backgrounds fill naturally, and no one will know they were ever there.

**Alt text (Before):** "Photo with ex-partner that needs to be removed."
**Alt text (After):** "Photo after removing ex-partner, with clean natural background."

---

#### H3 4) Keep only certain people

**Copy:**
Keep the people you care about and **remove unwanted people from pictures**—whether that's background strangers, distant relatives, or anyone you'd rather not keep in the frame. This is the fastest way to clean up group photos without redoing the whole shot.

Even when people are pressed together—hair crossing, arms touching, shoulders overlapping—edges stay clean and shadows blend naturally. This is where most tools fail. Ours doesn't.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo with several extra people in the frame."
**Alt text (After):** "Group photo with only selected people kept after removal."

---

#### H3 5) Solo portrait from a group shot

**Copy:**
Need a clean "just me" photo? **Remove others from a group shot** to create a solo portrait—for a memorial slideshow, presentation, profile photo, or resume.

Skin texture stays natural, the background fills in seamlessly, and even tricky areas near shoulders and hair come out clean.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo intended to be turned into a solo portrait."
**Alt text (After):** "Solo portrait created by removing other people from the group photo."

---

#### H3 6) Print-worthy moments (weddings & events)

**Copy:**
For **wedding photos**, formal events, invitations, and framed prints, small mistakes become obvious. Brush removal helps you get a cleaner photo that still looks authentic—ready when you need it, even on the same day.

Fine details like lace, veils, hair, and fabric edges stay sharp. Lighting stays consistent. Patterns don't repeat unnaturally. The result holds up at full resolution—ready for print.

**Alt text (Before):** "Wedding photo with distracting background guests."
**Alt text (After):** "Wedding photo cleaned for print after removing background people."

### H2 Go beyond removal

**Lead:**
Your removal is complete—ready to download and use. But sometimes you want to take it further: recompose the frame, bring people together, or try a different background.

Most tools stop at removal. For anything else, you'd open Photoshop. We let you keep creating—all inside the same editor, right after removal. This is what sets us apart.

**How to access:**
After brush removal, click **"Continue Editing"** inside the editor.

**Slider labels (this module):** After removal / After AI Edit

---

#### H3 1) Extend the frame and re-compose

Want a wider shot or a different crop? Expand the canvas and reposition your subject—no need to settle for what the original frame gave you.

Other tools stop at removal. Ours lets you reshape the entire composition.

**Alt text (Before):** "Photo after removal, with subject off-center."
**Alt text (After):** "Same photo with extended frame and subject re-centered."

---

#### H3 2) Move people closer

Want a tighter group shot? Bring everyone together naturally—no cutting and pasting, no obvious seams.

Other tools stop at removal. Ours lets you reposition who's left.

**Alt text (Before):** "Group photo after removal, with space between remaining people."
**Alt text (After):** "Same group photo with people moved closer together."

---

#### H3 3) Change background

The removal is done, but the background doesn't match the moment. Swap to a cleaner backdrop—studio, scenic, or simply less distracting.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original busy background."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with a new, simpler background."

---

#### H3 4) Polish the look

Unify lighting and color so the final result feels intentional—natural tones, cinematic contrast, or a warmer mood for events and portraits.

**Alt text (Before):** "Cleaned photo with original lighting and color."
**Alt text (After):** "Cleaned photo with polished lighting and color."

---

#### H3 5) Enhance resolution

Working with a video screenshot or an old low-res photo? Upscale it to print-ready quality. Details get sharper, textures stay natural, and the result holds up at larger sizes.

**Alt text (Before):** "Low-resolution photo with visible pixelation."
**Alt text (After):** "Same photo upscaled with enhanced clarity and detail."

### H2 FAQ

#### Quality

1. **Will removal change the faces I want to keep?**
   No. Brush removal only affects the areas you brush. Faces and features you don't touch stay exactly as they are.

2. **How do I avoid an "AI look" after removal?**
   Zoom to 100% and check edges, repeating patterns, and shadows. If it looks believable up close, it'll look great everywhere.

3. **Will it work on complex backgrounds (trees, fences, crowds, patterns)?**
   Often yes—complex textures just require more careful brushing and a closer 100% check.

4. **What if people overlap or block each other (hair/hands/clothing)?**
   We handle overlap well. Zoom in, work in small sections, and you'll get clean edges even where people are touching or crossing.

5. **Does it handle veils, lace, or semi-transparent materials?**
   It can, but thin/semi-transparent edges need careful brushing. Zoom in and work slowly around the edge details.

6. **Does it remove shadows automatically?**
   Brush over both the person and their shadow. The tool fills both areas naturally—shadows don't get left behind.

7. **What if the person I'm removing is hugging or touching someone I want to keep?**
   Brush carefully around the contact area. We handle these tricky spots well—zoom in and work in small sections for the cleanest result.

#### Capability

8. **How do I remove people from photos online?**
   Upload your photo, brush over the people you want to remove, then download the result. Results update in real time as you brush.

9. **Can I keep some people and remove others (keep X, remove Y)?**
   Yes. Brush only who you want gone—everyone else stays untouched.

10. **Can I remove multiple people at once?**
    Yes. Remove people in sections for better control, especially in crowds or busy backgrounds.

11. **Can I make a solo portrait from a group photo?**
    Yes. Remove others from the group shot, then export or re-frame for a clean solo portrait.

12. **Can I remove crowds or background people from travel photos?**
    Yes. For large crowds, removing in smaller sections helps keep textures and lines looking natural.

13. **Can I move people closer together after removal?**
    Yes. After brush removal, click "Continue Editing" to bring people together naturally—no cutting and pasting required.

14. **Can I remove my ex from photos?**
    Yes. Brush over them, download a clean result, and keep the photo without the person.

#### Technical

15. **Does it work on my phone?**
    Yes—use it in a modern mobile browser (Safari or Chrome). No app download needed.

16. **Can I use a video screenshot or low-resolution image?**
    Yes. For better results, use "Continue Editing" to upscale after removal—details get sharper and the photo becomes print-ready.

17. **Can I remove people from multiple photos at once (batch)?**
    Not yet. Each photo is processed individually for now.

18. **How long does processing take?**
    Results appear in real time as you brush—usually within seconds. Export is ready as soon as you're happy with the result.

#### Privacy

19. **Do you store my photos?**
    Photos are stored temporarily for processing and automatically deleted within 24 hours. We do not share your photos publicly or use them to train AI models.
